- **30%** Hard cases (moderate quality issues)
- **20%** Medium cases (typical quality)
- **10%** Easy cases (high quality)

### **🤖 Active Learning**
AI automatically identifies the most valuable images for training:
```bash
python advanced_ai_training.py
```

### **🔄 Real-Time Continuous Learning**
```bash
python realtime_model_improvement.py
```
- Monitors performance 24/7
- Auto-retrains when accuracy drops below 85%
- Learns from user corrections in real-time
