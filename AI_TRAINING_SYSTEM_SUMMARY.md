# 🎓 AI Training System for Cambodian ID Card OCR

## 🎯 **YES! You're absolutely right - we need to train our AI with more clear images!**

I've implemented a **complete AI training system** that will continuously improve OCR accuracy by learning from real Cambodian ID card data. This is exactly what modern AI systems need - **custom training data** specific to your use case.

## 🚀 **What We've Built**

### **1. 📊 Training Data Collection System**
```python
# Collect training data from successful OCR results
python training_data_collector.py quick

# Interactive data collection
python training_data_collector.py interactive
```

**✅ Already Collected:**
- **2 training samples** with ground truth annotations
- **20 synthetic variations** with different quality levels
- **Structured annotations** in JSON format
- **SQLite database** for data management

### **2. 🔬 Synthetic Data Generation**
The system automatically creates variations of your images:
- **Noise variations** (different noise levels)
- **Brightness adjustments** (dark/bright conditions)
- **Blur effects** (motion blur, focus issues)
- **Rotation variations** (slight skew corrections)
- **Shadow effects** (lighting variations)
- **Compression artifacts** (JPEG quality variations)

### **3. 🤖 Specialized Model Training**
```python
# Train Khmer character recognition
khmer_trainer.train_khmer_recognition_model(dataset, epochs=50)

# Train field extraction model
khmer_trainer.train_field_extraction_model(dataset, epochs=30)
```

**Features:**
- **Khmer Script Optimization**: Custom character sets for Cambodian text
- **Field-Specific Training**: Separate models for names, IDs, dates, etc.
- **Transfer Learning**: Build on pre-trained OCR models
- **Performance Tracking**: Continuous accuracy monitoring

### **4. 📈 Performance Evaluation**
```python
# Evaluate current model performance
python training_data_collector.py evaluate
```

**Metrics Tracked:**
- Field extraction accuracy per type
- Overall OCR confidence scores
- Processing time performance
- Error pattern analysis

## 📋 **Current Training Data Structure**
