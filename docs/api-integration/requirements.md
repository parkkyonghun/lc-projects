# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing API integration in the LC Work Flow application. Currently, the application uses local storage (SQLite) to store customer loan applications. The goal is to develop a robust API integration layer that will allow the application to synchronize data with a backend server while maintaining offline capabilities.

The backend will be built using FastAPI (Python) with PostgreSQL as the primary database and DragonFly DB for caching and real-time data. This stack provides high performance, strong typing, and excellent developer experience while meeting the requirements for a scalable loan application system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a loan officer, I want my locally saved applications to automatically sync with the central server when I have internet connectivity, so that all customer data is securely stored and accessible to authorized personnel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app has internet connectivity THEN the system SHALL automatically sync local data with the server
2. WHEN a new application is created or updated locally THEN the system SHALL queue it for synchronization
3. WHEN sync is complete THEN the system SHALL update the local status to reflect server sync status
4. WHEN sync fails THEN the system SHALL retry automatically with exponential backoff
5. WHEN the app is offline THEN the system SHALL store changes locally and sync when connectivity is restored

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a loan officer, I want to be able to see the sync status of each application, so that I know which applications have been successfully uploaded to the central server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the application list THEN the system SHALL display sync status indicators for each application
2. WHEN an application is pending sync THEN the system SHALL show a "pending upload" status
3. WHEN an application has been synced THEN the system SHALL show a "synced" status
4. WHEN an application sync has failed THEN the system SHALL show a "sync failed" status with retry option
5. WHEN tapping on a sync status indicator THEN the system SHALL show detailed sync information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a loan officer, I want to be able to manually trigger synchronization for specific applications or all applications, so that I can ensure critical data is uploaded immediately when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the application list THEN the system SHALL provide a "sync all" option
2. WHEN viewing an individual application THEN the system SHALL provide a "sync now" option
3. WHEN manual sync is triggered THEN the system SHALL show a progress indicator
4. WHEN manual sync completes THEN the system SHALL show a success message
5. WHEN manual sync fails THEN the system SHALL show an error message with retry option

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the API integration to use secure authentication and data encryption, so that sensitive customer information is protected during transmission.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS for all communications
2. WHEN authenticating with the server THEN the system SHALL use OAuth 2.0 or JWT authentication
3. WHEN storing authentication tokens THEN the system SHALL use secure storage
4. WHEN tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh them
5. WHEN a security error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the user out and require re-authentication

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a loan officer, I want to be able to download and view applications submitted by other officers, so that I can assist with or take over their customers if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connected to the internet THEN the system SHALL provide an option to browse all applications on the server
2. WHEN viewing server applications THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by status, date, and officer
3. WHEN selecting a server application THEN the system SHALL download it to local storage
4. WHEN a downloaded application is modified THEN the system SHALL sync changes back to the server
5. WHEN multiple officers modify the same application THEN the system SHALL handle conflict resolution

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API integration to be implemented with a clean architecture that separates concerns, so that the codebase remains maintainable and testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing API services THEN the system SHALL follow repository pattern with clear separation from UI
2. WHEN handling API responses THEN the system SHALL use proper error handling and data validation
3. WHEN implementing data models THEN the system SHALL use consistent serialization/deserialization
4. WHEN writing API integration code THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive unit tests
5. WHEN adding new API endpoints THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a loan officer, I want the application to gracefully handle poor network conditions, so that I can continue working in areas with limited connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connection is slow THEN the system SHALL continue functioning without UI freezes
2. WHEN a request times out THEN the system SHALL retry with appropriate backoff strategy
3. WHEN connection quality changes THEN the system SHALL adapt sync behavior accordingly
4. WHEN large files need to be uploaded THEN the system SHALL support resumable uploads
5. WHEN operating in low-bandwidth conditions THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical data sync

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a loan manager, I want to receive real-time updates when applications are submitted or modified, so that I can review and process them promptly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an application status changes THEN the system SHALL send real-time notifications to the server
2. WHEN new comments are added THEN the system SHALL sync them immediately if online
3. WHEN critical fields are updated THEN the system SHALL prioritize syncing these changes
4. WHEN a manager is viewing an application THEN the system SHALL show real-time updates from other users
5. WHEN multiple updates occur THEN the system SHALL batch them efficiently to reduce network usage
